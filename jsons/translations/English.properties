### - General Changes to make - ###
# The following list are items that the mod changes it's name trough all the translations. Have them always in mind!
# When you see "Read as:", means that you have to translate THAT, instead of the line under
# Example: Read as: No Crash Sites
#          No Ancient Ruins = No Crash Sites ( <- in your language)
# NOT:     Read as: No Crash Sites
#          No Ancient Ruins = No Ancient Ruins ( <- in your language)
